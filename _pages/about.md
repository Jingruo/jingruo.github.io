# About Me

I am a second-year Master's student in Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://stanford.edu/~yyye/), [Prof. Madeleine Udell](https://web.stanford.edu/~udell/), and [Prof. Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io/). Before joining Stanford, I received my B.S. degree with high honors in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Michigan. During my undergraduate studies, I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Asaf Cohen](https://sites.google.com/site/asafcohentau/home) and [Prof. Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu/home). I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Fall 2025. 

# Research Interests

My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of optimization, decision-making, and machine learning. Specifically, I am excited about exploring:  

- Online algorithms and mathematical programming
- Sequential decision-making under uncertainty
- Machine-learning methodology for large-scale optimization

In general, I am fascinated by how advanced mathematical skills and modern machine-learning techniques could revolutionize optimization theories and their applications to unlock new possibilities for solving complex real-impact problems.
