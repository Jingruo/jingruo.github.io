We consider an optimal control problem where the average welfare of weakly interacting agents is of interest. We examine the mean-field control problem as the fluid approximation of the N-agent control problem with the setup of finite-state space, continuous-time, and finite horizon. The value function of the mean-field control problem is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the simplex. Adapted from the classical Galerkin method, we construct a Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to solve the HJB equation. Instead of seeking the reduced form of linear combinations, DGM approximates the solution using a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator and boundary conditions of the high-dimensional nonlinear PDE. The accuracy of DGM results is validated through various numerical experiments. We also establish theoretical support by proving the convergence result for DGM. Specifically, we show that the loss function can be made arbitrarily small given that the value function possesses sufficient regularity. Based on that, we further demonstrate that if the loss function converges to zero, the corresponding neural network approximators must converge uniformly to the true value function on the simplex. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for the high-dimensional mean-field control problem, leading to a reliable and efficient methodology for decision-making.
