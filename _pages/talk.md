The following presentations are in reverse chronological order. 

## 1. Deep Galerkin Method for Mean-Field Control Problem

Jingruo Sun, [INFORMS 2024 Annual Conference](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2024/)

<span style="font-size:85%;"> 
We consider a mean-field control problem focusing on the average welfare of weakly interacting agents with the setup of finite-state space, continuous-time, and finite horizon. The value function is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the simplex. We construct a Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to solve the HJB equation. DGM approximates the solution using a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator and boundary conditions of the high-dimensional nonlinear PDE. The accuracy of DGM results is validated through various numerical experiments. We also establish theoretical support by proving the convergence result for DGM. Specifically, we show that the loss function can be made arbitrarily small given that the value function possesses sufficient regularity. Based on that, we further demonstrate that if the loss function converges to zero, the corresponding neural network approximators must converge uniformly to the true value function on the simplex. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for the high-dimensional mean-field control problem, leading to a reliable and efficient methodology for decision-making.

## 2. The Development of Facticity: from Preliminary Findings to Accepted Implicit Knowledge

Tianyu Du, Jingruo Sun, and Yuze Sui, [IC2S2 2024](https://ic2s2-2024.org/), [ICSSI 2024](https://www.icssi.org/)

<span style="font-size:85%;"> 
This paper examines how scientific ideas transition from novel claims in published research to established, implicitly accepted facts. We propose a multi-phase process: (1) only a fraction of newly introduced ideas, initially shared via preprint or conference articles, receive attention and citations; (2) those “successful” ideas acquire stable associations, lose citation salience, and become categorical concepts (e.g., “recurrent neural networks”), signaling emerging consensus; and (3) eventually, these ideas appear in reference materials such as textbooks or Wikipedia, indicating fully integrated knowledge. This progression can reverse when previously accepted facts are contested, moving them back to the “bleeding edge” of research. Using data from arXiv (mathematics and computer science), Web of Science, and Wikipedia, we trace how focal concepts move through these phases—analyzing citation patterns, co-citation networks, and whether concepts are mentioned but not formally cited. We illustrate this process by charting the life trajectory of “Ricci flow” in mathematics, revealing how key ideas become consolidated over time.
