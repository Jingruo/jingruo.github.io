# Talks and Presentations

The following presentations are in reverse chronological order. 

## 1. Deep Galerkin Method for Mean-Field Control Problem

Jingruo Sun, [INFORMS 2024 Annual Conference](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2024/)

We consider a mean-field control problem focusing on the average welfare of weakly interacting agents under finite-state space, continuous-time, and finite horizon. The value function is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the simplex. We construct a Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to solve the HJB equation. DGM approximates the solution using a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator and boundary conditions of the high-dimensional nonlinear PDE. The accuracy of DGM is validated through various numerical experiments. As the theoretical support, we prove that the loss function converges to zero, and the corresponding neural network approximators converge uniformly to the true value function on the simplex. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for the high-dimensional mean-field control problem, leading to a reliable and efficient methodology for decision-making.

## 2. The Development of Facticity: from Preliminary Findings to Accepted Implicit Knowledge

Tianyu Du, Jingruo Sun, and Yuze Sui, [IC2S2 2024](https://ic2s2-2024.org/), [ICSSI 2024](https://www.icssi.org/)

<span style="font-size:85%;"> 
This paper examines how scientific ideas transition from novel claims in published research to established, implicitly accepted facts. We propose a multi-phase process: (1) only a fraction of newly introduced ideas, initially shared via preprint and receive attention and citations; (2) those ideas acquire stable associations, lose citation salience, and become categorical concepts, signaling emerging consensus; and (3) eventually, those ideas appear in reference materials such as textbooks or Wikipedia, indicating fully integrated knowledge. This progression can reverse when previously accepted facts are contested, moving them back to the "bleeding edge" of research. Using data from arXiv, Web of Science, and Wikipedia, we trace how focal concepts move through these phasesâ€”analyzing citation patterns, co-citation networks, and whether concepts are mentioned but not formally cited. We illustrate this process by charting the life trajectory of "Ricci flow" in mathematics, revealing how key ideas become consolidated over time.
